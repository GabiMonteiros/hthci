        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Home Tutors and Health Charity Initiative was born out of a need to improve the academic
        outcome of children and young adults in rural communities and to improve the overall health 
        of these communities. We provide tutoring and mentorship for youths who are negatively 
        impacted by the teacher strikes and shortcomings in the curriculum delivered to them so 
        that they can reach their full educational potential. We also deliver health services to 
        this community through annual yearly checkups by trained health care professionals and 
        activities that promote well-being.</p>
