            <h2>Our Story</h2> 
            <p><span style="color: rgb(67, 152, 47) ; font-style: italic ; font-weight:bold">Home Tutors and Health Charity Initiative </span>  is a Nigerian American non-governmental 
                organization working to improve the academic outcomes of youth in rural communities and the overall public health in these communities
                by working under the guidelines of these sustainable development goals: good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, 
                and clean water and sanitation. Many factors affect quality education and health so HTCHIâ€™s projects cover diverse areas that we believe
                can improve the literacy and health of our partner communities.
                <br> 
                We are an organization of trained individuals in the areas of healthcare, education, engineering, 
                and computer science putting our skills to uplift our communities.
                <br>     
                Our current partner community is Lejja, Nsukka LGA in the state of Enugu. We are looking forward to partnering with more communities in the future.
