                    <p>The organization provides health screenings and teachings for the rural population.
                    Healthcare services in Nigeria are privatized and people do not receive quality 
                    healthcare due to economic disposition. The health fair gives community residents 
                    an opportunity to know their current health status and learn about ways to improve 
                    their wellbeing.</p>

                    <p>Sanitation is a major contributor to the overall public health of our partner community.
                    Houses still lack toilets or proper waste collection sites. Our decentralized wastewater 
                    treatment projects use low-cost solutions to improve sanitation in the community. 
                    We install decentralized wastewater treatment that can treat gray and black water thereby
                     reducing barriers to good health and well-being.</p>
